# Changes after the update of August-September 2024

Major changes to the programming environments:

-   ROCm 6.0.3 is now the default ROCm version.

    The installed driver should be able to install ROCm version 5.6 to 6.2,
    but that does not imply that all of those versions will work with all
    versions of the Cray Programming Environment.
