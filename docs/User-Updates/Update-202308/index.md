# Changes after the update of August 2023

The main purpose of the August 2023 update of LUMI was to add in additional GPU hardware
that will become gradually available to users (as extensions of the current partitions).

However, a few changes are begin implemented to the scheduler, on of which has a large
inpact on GPU jobs, and we want to put more emphasis on proper and efficient use of the
system.
