# Changes after the update of August 2023

The main purpose of the August 2023 update of LUMI was to add in additional GPU hardware
that will become gradually available to users (as extensions of the current partitions).

However, a few changes were made to the scheduler, one of which has a large
impact on GPU jobs, and we also want to put more emphasis on proper and efficient use of the
system as queue times have become rather long lately.

-   [Changes to the low-noise mode on LUMI-G](lumig-lownoise.md). **These changes have 
    implications for job scripts so read carefully.**
-   [Policy change on dev-g and eap](lumig-devg.md)
-   [Responsible use of LUMI-C and LUMI-G](responsible-use.md)
