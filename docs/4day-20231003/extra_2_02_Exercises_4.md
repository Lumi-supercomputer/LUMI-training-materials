## Q&A

5. What is `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED` (in `gpu_env.sh`)? I don't think we covered that in slides.

    -   No. That comes tomorrow afternoon in the advanced Cray MPICH presentation. It is to enable GPU-aware MPI.

6. I'm not able to load `lumi-CPEtools`...

    - Did you load a `LUMI` module before trying to load   CPE tools?
    - Thanks! That was it.
    - We will discuss this afternoon how to use the software stack.
