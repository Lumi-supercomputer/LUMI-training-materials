-   Exercises can be copied from `/project/project_465000644/exercises/AMD/HPCTrainingExamples`

-   Exercises are archived as compressed and uncompressed tar files:
 
    -   [Web download .tar.bz2](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/4day-20231003/files/LUMI-4day-20231003-Exercises_AMD.tar.bz2)

    -   On LUMI:
        -   `/appl/local/training/4day-20231003/files/LUMI-4day-20231003-Exercises_AMD.tar.bz2`
        -   `/appl/local/training/4day-20231003/files/LUMI-4day-20231003-Exercises_AMD.tar`

-   The necessary version of OmniTrace is installed in the software installation in 
    `/project/project_465000644/software`.

    The installation can be recovered from the archive (bzip2-compressed tar file) on LUMI: 
    `/appl/local/training/4day-20231003/files/LUMI-4day-20231003-Software_AMD.tar.bz2`

    This installation was tested for the course but will fail at some point due to changes to the system.
