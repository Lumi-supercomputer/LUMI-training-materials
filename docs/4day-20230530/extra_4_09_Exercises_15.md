-   Exercises can be copied from `/project/project_465000524/exercises/AMD/HPCTrainingExamples`

-   Exercises are archived as compressed and uncompressed tar files:
 
    -   [Web download .tar.bz2](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/4day-20230530/files/LUMI-4day-20230530-Exercises_AMD.tar.bz2)
        or [web download .tar](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/4day-20230530/files/LUMI-4day-20230530-Exercises_AMD.tar)

    -   On LUMI:
        -   `/appl/local/training/4day-20230530/files/LUMI-4day-20230530-Exercises_AMD.tar.bz2`
        -   `/appl/local/training/4day-20230530/files/LUMI-4day-20230530-Exercises_AMD.tar`

-   The necessary version of Omniperf is installed in the software installation in 
    `/project/project_465000524/software`.

    The installation can be recovered from the archive (bzip2-compressed tar file) on LUMI: 
    `/appl/local/training/4day-20230530/files/LUMI-4day-20230530-Software_AMD.tar.bz2`

    This installation was tested for the course but will fail at some point due to changes to the system.

    Note that Omniperf poses security risks as it is based on an unprotected web server running on a predicable
    port number.
