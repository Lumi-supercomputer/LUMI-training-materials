# Introduction to Perftools

*Presenter: Alfio Lazzaro (HPE)*

-   Slides available on LUMI as:
    -   `/appl/local/training/4day-20230530/files/LUMI-4day-20230530-3_01_Introduction_to_Perftools.pdf`
    -   `/project/project_465000524/slides/HPE/09_introduction_to_perftools.pdf` (temporary, for the lifetime of the project)

These materials can only be distributed to actual users of LUMI (active user account).

!!! Info
    You can find the downloads of Apprentice2 and Reveal on LUMI in
    `$CRAYPAT_ROOT/share/desktop_installers/`. This only works when the
    `perftools-base` module is loaded, but this is the case at login.
