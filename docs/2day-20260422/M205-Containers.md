# Containers on LUMI-C and LUMI-G

*Presenter: Kurt Lust (LUST)*

Containers are a way on LUMI to deal with the too-many-small-files software
installations on LUMI, e.g., large Python or Conda installations. They are also a 
way to install software that is hard to compile, e.g., because no source code is
available or because there are simply too many dependencies.

<!--
There are two demos illustrating material from this talk:

-   [Demo 1](Demo1.md): Installing Fooocus on top of an existing container provided by LUST.
    This demo installs additional SUSE packages via the unprivileged proot build process and 
    then also adds a number of Python packages through a virtual environment stored outside 
    the container in a SquashFS file.

-   [Demo2](Demo2.md) shows how the EasyBuild modules for containers can make life easier
    when working with the AI containers provided by LUST (with the help from AMD). 

The videos of the demos are older ones, but the material in the notes was correct at the time of
the course.
