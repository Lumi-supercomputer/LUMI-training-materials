# Local information

## Venue

The hackathon takes place on the city campus of the University of Antwerp, 
[Prinsstraat 13](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tSYf3d8M35LjJ3BRA).

See the [map of the city campus](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/hackathon-20260518/files/hackathon-20260518-venue.pdf).

-   Monday till Thursday: Room C.101.
  
    This building can be accessed from Prinsstraat 13. The gate in the middle of the
    building will take you to a small courtyard. Cross that courtyard to the left
    corner, go through the corridor to a bigger courtyard, cross that one also to 
    the left corner, go through the large glass door, go forward through the first 
    hall to the next one which is building C.

-   Friday: Room D.226 which can also be entered through "Grote Kauwenberg"

The venue is within walking distance from the central station, with many hotels
also within walking distance.


## How to reach Antwerp?

-   [Brussels Airport (BRU)](https://www.brusselsairport.be/) is roughly half an hour by train 
    with two trains per hour to Antwerp Central station

-   [Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS)](https://www.schiphol.nl/) is 
    1h12 with the ["Eurocity Direct"](https://www.ns.nl/en/about-ns/dossier/hogesnelheidslijn/eurocity.html) 
    which is the cheaper option, certainly for flex tickets, 
    or 1h with the [Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/). 
    The EuroCity Direct goes almost every hour, the Eurostar has a more irregular schedule.

-   [Brussels South Charleroi Airport (CRL)](https://www.brussels-charleroi-airport.com/) is less interesting. 
    It is far outside Brussels and at the wrong side of Brussels. 
    Travel to and from the airport will easily take 2 hours as you either require a bus to Antwerp, 
    or a combination of bus and train. Don't be mislead by the fact that there is a direct train to the Charleroi: 
    That one does not pass by the airport so you still need a bus (with various possible connections, 
    either with a bus between Brussels and the airport or Luttre, a small village near Charleroi, and the airport.)


## Hotels

The most interesting locations for hotels with respect of ease of travel and proximity of the venue,
are the hotels near the [central station and Koninging Astridplein](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cSrn8de1Mg9Avcvw8),
the [De Keyserlei](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EoTPTjD98d75mDa47), the [Opera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P5B2UNAaSV5Boqwy7)
and [Franklin Rooseveltplaats](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VVGinwn55N17sad57), though you may also prefer to look for a hotel 
closer to the Antwerp Cathedral and [Grote Markt](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uESFHWyM4eRnnoTE8).
