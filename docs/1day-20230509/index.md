# LUMI 1-day training May 2023

## Organisation

-   [Schedule](schedule.md)

-   [HedgeDoc for off-line questions](https://md.sigma2.no/lumi-intro-course-16may23?edit)

    Notes from the May 9 session are summarised and archived on the
    ["Questions from the Hedgedoc document of the 9 May 2020 session"](notes_20230509.md) page.


## Setting up for the exercises

-   Create a directory in the scratch of the training project, or if you want to
    keep the exercises around for a while after the session and have already
    another project on LUMI, in a subdirectory or your project directory 
    or in your home directory (though we don't recommend the latter).
    Then go into that directory.

    E.g., in the scratch directory of the project:

    ```
    mkdir -p /scratch/project_465000522/$USER/exercises
    cd /scratch/project_465000522/$USER/exercises
    ```

-   Now download the exercises and un-tar:

    ```
    wget https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-training-materials/1day-20230509/files/exercises-20230509.tar.gz
    tar -xf exercises-20230509.tar.gz
    ```
