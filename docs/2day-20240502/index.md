# Supercomputing with LUMI - Amsterdam, May 2-3, 2024

## Course organisation

-   Location: [SURF, Science Park 140, 1098 XG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands](https://maps.app.goo.gl/11bPcfD6s93PNMZK6)

-   [Schedule](schedule.md)

<!--
-   [HedgeDoc for questions](https://md.sigma2.no/lumi-general-course-apr24?both)
-->

<!--
-   There are two Slurm reservations for the course:

    -   CPU nodes: `training_cpu`
    -   GPU nodes: `training-gpu`
-->


## Setting up for the exercises

If you have an active project on LUMI, you should be able to make the exercises in that project.
You will only need an very minimum of CPU and GPU billing units for this.

-   Create a directory in the scratch of your project, or if you want to
    keep the exercises around for a while, in a subdirectory of your project directory 
    or in your home directory (though we don't recommend the latter).
    Then go into that directory.

    E.g., in the scratch directory of your project:

    ```
    mkdir -p /scratch/project_465001102/$USER/exercises
    cd /scratch/project_465001102/$USER/exercises
    ```

    where you have to replace `project_465001102` using the number of your own project.

-   Now download the exercises and un-tar:

    ```
    wget https://465000095.lumidata.eu/2day-20240502/files/exercises-20240502.tar.gz
    tar -xf exercises-20240502.tar.gz
    ```

-   You're all set to go!

which in turn was prepared in the framework of the 
[VSC](https://www.vscentrum.be/) Tier-0 support activities.
