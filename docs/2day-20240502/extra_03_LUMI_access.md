## Q&A

1.  Are there plans to have LUMI as a Globus end point ?

    -    We don't have it at the moment and unfortunately, we don't have the man power to add it.

2.  Do you you other tools e.g., iRODS for data transfer/storage management? 
    I am curious to know if projects use some automation to move data from/to LUMI, 
    or users do it themselves (irrespective of the size oftheir data)

    -   We currently don't have the iRODS tools on LUMI. There was a request from my home country 
        (Flanders/Belgium) so their local support team is looking into it. As we shall also discuss 
        in the support talk, we are open to help from local support teams for such things so I hope 
        they will do the installation in a way that we can then offer the recipe to other users also. 
        What we as the LUMI support team cannot do is tell users how it should be configured to access, 
        e.g., the VSC or Surf iRODS infrastructures as we are not managing those infrastructures.
