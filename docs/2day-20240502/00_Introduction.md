# Introduction to the notes

These notes and training materials were prepared in the framework of the 
[VSC](https://www.vscentrum.be/) Tier-0 support activities.

The notes, and all other materials used for the course, borrow a lot from the
course material made available by the LUMI User Support Team.
Their course materials are avialable on the
[LUMI training materias web site](https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-training-materials/).

Various training materials and the documentation from the Walloon HPC project [CÃ‰CI](https://www.ceci-hpc.be/)
were also a great source of inspiration.

This course is offered to the LUMI-BE organisation.


## About the structure of the notes

Colour coding and boxes in the material:

!!! remark
    This is a remark: Some additional information that may be nice to read. or some
    additional information that you may want to have a look at.

!!! Note
    Just a quick note on the side, but do have a look at it.

!!! audience
    A box telling you who this part of the notes is written for, or why it would be
    good to read it even if you think you don't need it.

!!! lumi-be
    This is used to point out differences with local infrastructures in Belgium and
    is less useful if you are not familiar with any of the HPC clusters in Belgium.

!!! example
    An example to make the material clearer or to try something out.

!!! exercise
    An exercise

!!! solution
    The solution to the exercise. You will have to click on the box to see the solution.

!!! bug
    This is a discussion about a bug.

!!! nice-to-know
    This is a little fact which is nice-to-know but not necessary to understand the
    material.

!!! intermediate
    Information that may not be useful to every LUMI user, but if you are the kind of
    person who likes to explore manuals and try out things that we did not discuss
    in the course, you may want to read this...

!!! advanced
    Similar to the intermediate material, but it requires even more technical skills to
    understand this stuff.

!!! technical
    Material specific to readers with very technical interests.
