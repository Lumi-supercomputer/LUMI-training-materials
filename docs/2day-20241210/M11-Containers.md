# Containers on LUMI-C and LUMI-G

*Presenter: Kurt Lust*

Containers are a way on LUMI to deal with the too-many-small-files software
installations on LUMI, e.g., large Python or Conda installations. They are also a 
way to install software that is hard to compile, e.g., because no source code is
available or because there are simply too many dependencies.
