# Process and Thread Distribution and Binding

*Presenter: Jorik van Kemenade*

To get good performance on hardware with a strong hierarchy as AMD EPYC processors and
        GPUs, it is important to map processes and threads properly on the hardware. This talk discusses
        the various mechanisms available on LUMI for this.
