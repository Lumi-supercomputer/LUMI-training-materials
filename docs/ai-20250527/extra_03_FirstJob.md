## Extra materials

<!--
More materials will become available during and shortly after the course
-->

-   [Presentation slides](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/ai-20250527/files/LUMI-ai-20250527-03-First_AI_job.pdf)

-   [Hands-on exercises](E03_FirstJob.md)

-   [More extensive training materials on Slurm from the recent introductory "Supercomputing with LUMI" course from March 2025](../2p3day-20250303/index.md)

    -   A more detailed introduction to Slurm but without AI-specific examples is given in the 
        ["Slurm on LUMI" presentation](../2p3day-20250303/M201-Slurm.md).
        It also discusses the `sacct` command that can be used to get at least some resource use info
        from jobs.

    -   The presentation ["Process and Thread Distribution and Binding"](../2p3day-20250303/M202-Binding.md)
        is more oriented towards traditional HPC codes, but the discussion on a proper mapping
        of GPU dies onto CPU chiplets is also relevant for AI applications. But that is a discussion
        for the second day of this course/workshop.
