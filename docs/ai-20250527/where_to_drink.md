# Water, or something better?

Disclaimer: This page is not written by a local, but by someone from Belgium who visits Amsterdam
from time to time. Hence it is biased towards his interests.

I'm not so much in the kind of night entertainment offered at the "Ouderzijds Voorburgwal" and
"Ouderzijds Achterburgwal" so no advice about that area. 
However, Amsterdam has more to offer at night. Though we, Belgians,
used to compare Dutch beer with dirty water, nowadays the Netherlands in general and Amsterdam
in particular have a nice craft beer scene. 
Most beers are more than decent, and some of those beers are truly excellent. 
So here are some breweries in the city with taprooms, and some other craft beer bars. 
They may very well give you a much cheaper evening than the entertainment at "De Wallen"
and are as effective in forgetting the stress of a busy course day.

## Breweries

All those breweries also have a taproom unless otherwise indicated. I haven't tried them
all yet though.

For some breweries, I also provide links to a web site that lists all their beers, including
scores given by users of that web site. This is for all beers that they made through their 
recent history and does by no means imply that you can order all those beers now. If I know 
of a list that mirrors what is available now, I've included that list instead as the menu.

The list is sorted according to walking distance from the SURF building in Science Park,
but you'll have to be a good swimmer for one of them (or take a free ferry).

-   [Poesiat & Kater](https://poesiatenkater.nl/).
    This brewery is just 1.4km walking from the SURF building in Science Park
    and so could be your first place to get some relief after a hard course day.
    They also serve food, but I haven't tried their restaurant yet.

-   ['t IJ](https://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/)
   
    The brewery has three taprooms:

    -   [De Molen in De Gooyer](https://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/proeflokaal-de-molen/),
        at the original brewery. (There is now a second location 700m further
        but without a taproom.)

        ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fR4DqjknFLHdFLX56)) <!-- 2.7km -->

    -   [Café Struis](https://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/cafe-struis/),
        next to De Molen

        ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oWw6BXmqi1fg4zjr7))

    -   [Proeflokaal ‘t Blauwe Theehuis](https://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/proeflokaal-het-blauwe-theehuis/)
        in the Vondelpark and close to the famous "Museumplein" with some of the main museums of
        Amsterdam.

-   [Brouwerij Homeland](https://brouwerijhomeland.nl/):
    Located in a hotel-restaurant in the centre of Amsterdam.

    first world war (in which The Netherlands were not occupied).

-   [Oedipus Craft Space](https://oedipus.com/) is the
    taproom of Oedipus in Amsterdam-Noord, across the river IJ. This no longer really a small craft beer brewery,
    but has become rather large and is now a subsidiary of Heineken.

-   [De Bierfabriek](https://www.bierfabriek.com/amsterdam/en/):
    Brewery and restaurant in the centre of the city, not far from the Rokin 
    metro station. The beer is slightly below avereage though.

    cities in the Netherlands (also in Den Haag and Groningen). 
    There is only one location left in Amsterdam,
    in the Oudezijds Armsteeg, right in the centre and a short walk from
    the central station.

-   Brouwerij Troost has two locations

    -   [Locatie De Pijp](https://brouwerijtroost.nl/depijp-amsterdam/),
        at the Cornelis Troostplein, is where it all started. Nowadays it is 
        their experimental brewery. They serve food also.

    -   [Locatie Westergas](https://brouwerijtroost.nl/westergas-amsterdam/)
        is their newer location. A formal industrial site used by the gas company now
        turned into an area with bars and lots of cultural activities. It is now also
        their main production site. They have a complete menu.

-   [Two Chefs Restaurant and Taproom](https://twochefsbrewing.com/)
    with the restaurant and taproom next to one another. Two chefs who
    started brewing their own beers to go with the food. The beers became
    so successful that nowadays it is brewed in a different location in the 
    port of Amsterdam, but that location cannot be visited.

    ([Scores of their beers](https://untappd.com/TwoChefsBrewing/beer))

-   [Gebrouwen door Vrouwen BAR](https://www.gebrouwendoorvrouwen.nl/de-bar):
    Beer brewed by women. They have no brewery of their own, but use the
    installations of other breweries to brew beer according to their recipes.

-   [Brouwerij Kleiburg](https://www.kleiburg.nl/) at De Bijlmer and hence
    a bit outside the centre of Amsterdam. If you'd go there, look for "De Proefzaak".

    ([Scores on Untappd](https://untappd.com/Kleiburg/beer))

-   [Brouwerij de 7 deugden](https://de7deugden.nl/):
    A bit far outside the centre, and it closes at 6pm so
    it cannot be combined with the course unless you stay a bit longer
    in Amsterdam. It is also closed on Sundays so coming early won't help,
    nor will staying longer as November 1 is a public holiday and hence
    like a Sunday.

## Craft beer bars

The first two are the ones I usually go to. 

-   [Bierproeflokaal In De Wildeman](https://www.indewildeman.nl/) 
    in a former distillery. Pleasantly close to the central station, so if 
    you have time on Thursday evening after the course, you could still try it
    before catching the train. You can also snack a bit. The cheese platter
    is recommended, or you can try some Dutch "Ossenworst" to integrate with
    the locals (assuming you're not Dutch of course).

    ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FcZvwbLMcWkjihEJ9))
    ([Beer menu](https://untappd.com/v/bierproeflokaal-in-de-wildeman/23108))

-   [Proeflokaal Arendsnest](https://www.arendsnest.nl/).
    Also a nice place to snack with a beer. I can highly recommend the cheese
    platter (I usuale take the 2.0).

    ([Beer and snacks menu](https://untappd.com/v/proeflokaal-arendsnest/50640))

-   [Craft & Draft](https://www.craftanddraft.nl/).
    I haven't been there myself yet, but found the place recommended in various places.

    ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WzHpKAGa6bkJkyJB8))
    ([Beer menu](https://untappd.com/v/craft-and-draft/2602601))

-   [BeerTemple](https://www.beertemple.nl/). I have never been at this place.
    The name sounds as one that should mostly attract tourists. 
    But though their web site advertises as an "American Beer Bar",
    they have a nice selection of local beers also, and the typical
    Dutch snacks (did someone call for "bitterballen"?)
