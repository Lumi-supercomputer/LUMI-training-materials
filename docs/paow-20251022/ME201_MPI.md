# Exercises (session 5)

Exercises on MPI optimizations.

Exercises are in `Exercises/HPE/day2/ProgrammingModels`.

Test the Pi example with MPI or MPI/OpenMP on 4 nodes and 4 tasks.

Show where the ranks/threads are running by using the appropriate MPICH environment variable.

Use environment variables to change this order (rank-reordering)
