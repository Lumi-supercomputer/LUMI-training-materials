# Suggestions for the evening

Note that this is a biased list, made up by someone who is not very hungry at night after
a hotel breakfast and a lunch at the university, but who can appreciate a good beer.
Estonians know how to brew a good sour, an excellent and sometimes very strong 
stout, and then there is also the Baltic Porter...
The author of this list has been in Tallinn twice before.

Several of these places are close to one another, in the Telliskivi district, behind the main
railway station. This has become a very hip place in recent years, with lots of restaurants,
bars and cultural activities.

Tallinn has several small breweries with taproom

-   [Humalakoda taproom](https://www.humalakoda.ee/), offers food also. 
    It is in the Telliskivi district. They have some of their own beers on tap,
    but also a bottle selection of both some more special beers of their own and
    beers from some other Estonian and non-Estonian breweries.

-   [Kochi Aidad](https://kochiaidad.ee/en/kochi-aidad/): Restaurant and brewery bar. 
    Their own beers are only average, but the food is good and affordable and the 
    place has an interesting atmosphere. You can also see some of the brewery infrastructure
    through a window.

-   [Pöhjala taproom](https://www.pohjalabeer.com/visit/pohjala-tap-room)
    and [brewery](https://www.pohjalabeer.com/). A bit further away from the centre
    in the Noblessner district, a former submarine shipyard. Serves some food also.
    This area has become a rather hip area also in recent years.

-   [Pühaste Taproom Tallinn](https://puhaste-taproom.ourmenu.com/?menu=226736):
    In a new area just west from the old town and close to the ferry terminal.
    They tend to have an interesting selection on tap, but also many special 
    bottles.
    Pühaste is a brewery located in Tartu, two hours from Tallinn.

-   [Tuletorn Brewing](https://tuletorn.beer/): Far from the centre and the tram is 
    needed to get there. I've never been there.

-   [Vaat](https://vaat.ee/): Brewery taproom in the Telliskivi district.

Good bars:

-   [Drink Bar & Grill](https://www.facebook.com/Drinkbaarandgrill/) but few Estonian beers on tap.
    They offer good and affordable food.
    This place is in the old town, but not in the most touristic streets.

Other suggestions from locals:

-   [Hell Hunt](https://hellhunt.ee/en/) is a restaurant and bar just a few 100 meters
    from Town Hall Square, with a selection of Estonian and foreign beers.
    They do seem to have good connections with Humalakoda mentioned above.
    ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iZRNY5bck99RxHrT8))

-   [Restaurant Argentiina](https://argentiina.ee/?lang=en):
    A bit outside the old town, towards the airport. Mostly for meat lovers,
    but they do have some fish dishes and dishes for vegetarians, so you can take
    your non-meatloving friends to the restaurant also.
