# The HPE Cray Programming Environment

*Presenter: Kurt Lust (LUST)*

As Linux itself is not a complete supercomputer operating system, many components
that are essential for the proper functioning of a supercomputer are separate packages
(such as the [Slurm scheduler](M201-Slurm.md) discussed later in this course) or part 
of programming environments. 
It is important to understand the consequences of this, even if all you want is to simply
run a program.
