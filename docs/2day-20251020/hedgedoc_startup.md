# Intro to Supercomputing with LUMI - Hybrid course (2.-3.06.25)
2.-3.06.2025
8:00--16:30 (CEST) / 9:00--17:30 (EEST)

:::info
Please ask your questions that come up during a session in the section of that session. If they are about a previous session, we'll move them up after answering, but it is hard to keep an eye on the entire document.

Please don't ask questions about talks that still have to be given. The first hour of the course does not serve to answer all questions that will be answered in later talks anyway.

## Future LUMI events

### Public HPC coffee break
(Usually) Every last Wednesday of the month. Due to June holidays, the next one is on 
**18.06.25, 13:00-13:45 (CEST) / 14:00--14:45(EEST)**
Meet the LUMI user support team, discuss problems, give feedback or suggestions on how to improve services, and get advice for your projects. 
[Join via Zoom](https://cscfi.zoom.us/j/65727034273?pwd=VEdtY2trVUVKTEhxajZMbFhETWV2Zz09)

### LUMI datacenter electric breaker maintenance 8-16 June 2025
An electric breaker maintenance will be performed in the LUMI datacenter starting on Sunday 8 June with the shutdown of the whole system. LUMI is planned to be restarted and back to operational state on Monday 16 June.During the whole break, LUMI login nodes, LUMI compute nodes, and all storage partitions (LUMI-P, LUMI-F, and LUMI-O) won't be accessible.


## Course schedule

You can find the schedule here: https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-training-materials/2day-20250602/schedule/


## Slides and other material

After the training, the slides will be made available at https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-training-materials/2day-20250602/ (and many will become available during the course).

The talks will be recorded (question sessions are not recorded) and recordings will be made available on this link also. This may take a while (last days of June) as the person processing the recordings has another training immediately after this one, no uploads can be done while LUMI-O is down, and then he is on vacation.
