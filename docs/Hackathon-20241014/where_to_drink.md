# Curing mental distress after a hard day on LUMI

We do realise that at night, you want to forget all the misery from the day. 
The hunting for bugs, the temperamental file system of LUMI that freezes when you
want to save your file so that it takes ages to get out of the editor...

Belgium has a very famous medicine for curing that mental distress. It is called
"beer" and is available in large quantities allover the city, with something
for every taste and budget. Some are even made for people who need a very strong
medicine to forget. You cannot get it at pharmacies though (though the latter then
have a remedy for the day after if you take an overdose of the medicine "beer"),
but in specialised businesses called "bar" or "café".

The centre of the city is very touristic though and unfortunately this is not the place
to find the best beer as too many tourists go for the cheaper volume stuff. The first
couple of places in the list below are rather close to the central station and Grande Place
though and have more to offer than the big tourist bars that I also mention.

Note that most bars in Brussels will have some of the local microbrewery beers on their
menu and not only the large-volume industrial beers.

Some especially noteworthy places near the city centre:

-   If you really, really want to be in the places where all tourists are (not my thing though),
    people usually mention:

    -   [Delirium Café & Taphouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1p9Vbt22M3XtUfMe8) or

    -   [Beer Capital Brussels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MJhrndDXxsSE52yp6).

    I personally think that it is better to have 50 beers available that the staff knows
    than 2000 beers of which half are only available on the menu and not in the fridges,
    and that the staff does not know.

    -   [BrewDog Brussels](https://www.brewdog.com/eu_en/brewdog-brussels)
        ([Putterie 20](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BbN6q1R67o6b83rQ8))
        is a subsidiary of the Brewdog group that you can find in many big cities in Europe.

        Not bad if you are in an urgent need when walking back from the hackathon venue 
        to your hotel in the historic city centre and are in urgent need for some medicine,
        and it could be an option on Friday noon also if it is too early to leave to the 
        airport but you want to be close to the station as you don't want to carry around
        your luggage.

So some of the places I like more:

-   [Moeder Lambic Fontainas](https://www.moederlambic.com/?lang=en) ([Place Fontainas/Fontainasplein 8]()) is a good choice 
    right in the city centre if you want a more typical place and not one that really aims at tourists as
    the places we mentioned before.
    Moeder Lambic cannot compete with these in number of beers, but they do have more than just the stuff 
    from the large breweries.

-   [La Porte Noir](https://www.laportenoire.be/)
    ([Rue des Alexiens/Cellebroerstraat 67](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Cq9AuWFGEZwJUjp8))
    is an underground bar in the basement of a former monastery. 
    The selection is small, but they do have a selection of nice beers, both on tap
    and in the fridges.
    It is right next to the [Brasserie des Alexiens](https://www.brasseriedesalexiens.be/) 
    (Rue des Alexiens/Cellebroersstraat 63) which is a highly recommended restaurant.

-   [GIST](https://www.instagram.com/gistbeerandco)
    ([Oud Korenhuis/Place de la Vieille Halle aux Blés 30](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QNFAr5GGiWP5bmVz6))
    You can [check their menu here](https://untappd.com/v/gist-brussels/6957492).

    In summer, the place is open every day but it might be closed on Monday during the Hackathon.

-   Less a craft beer bar and more a nice pub with a large selection of beers:
    [Poechenellekelder](https://poechenellekelder.be/)
    ([Eikstraat/Rue du Chêne 5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yJgprg33RQrVHv8Q6)).
    It is very close to one of the main tourist attractions of Brussels
    though, [Manneken Pis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L8WApGo75kC8ZKv6A),
    so not my personal choice though.

There are lots of breweries with taprooms in Brussels. These are usually a bit further away
from the historic city centre and outside the area known as the "pentagon"
(look on a map and notice a more or less pentagonal area surrounded by bigger 
roads and you'll know what I mean). I mention those places that are closest
to the city centre only:

-   [Brussels Beer Project](https://beerproject.be/) 
    started as a very small brewery but thanks to good marketing,
    they are now rather big.

    -   Their [original site and taproom](https://beerproject.be/pages/dansaert-taproom#) is 
        at [Antoine Dansaertstraat/Rue Antoine Dansaert 188](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5DXFSvdRs8QqzqRY9),
        still inside the Pentagon. When I last checked, the place was open Tuesday till Saturday.

    -   They now also have a [taproom in the Bailli area](https://beerproject.be/pages/bailli-taproom)
        ([Baljuwstraat/Rue du Bailli 1/A](https://maps.app.goo.gl/24PYbUGtTEMiYQN88)),
        easy to reach by tram from the park between the Parliament and Royal Palace near
        HOEK38.

-   Saint-Gilles, south of the pentagon, is a very multicultural community. Yet there are some
    very nice beer bars.

    -   [L'Ermitage Saint-Gilles](https://ermitagesaintgilles.be/) 
        ([Rue de Moscou/Moskoustraat 34](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rdehVg3gKfcP9EqP6))
        is now the main taproom of the [ L'Ermitage brewery](https://ermitagenanobrasserie.be/)
        as they outgrew their [taproom at their original location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RG7Gc4RFASawfGyn7)
        (which in fact is only open in the weekend).

        They serve pizza also and are open every day.

    -   A bit further in Saint-Gilles is 
        [Moeder Lambic Original]()
        ([Savoistraat/Rue de Savoie 68](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yU1r7mZFRPjZZEUg7)).
        A good place to drink the beer type that the Brussels area is most known for,
        Geuze and Lambic.

    -   An old favourite of mine is [Dynamo - Bar de Soif](https://untappd.com/v/dynamo-bar-de-soif/3823875)
        at the [Alsembergsesteenweg/Chaussée d'Alsemberg 130](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LVk2xdmSCVccQ5ft9).
        Most beers on tap are not Belgian though, and the place specialises somewhat in
        British beers. They do have more in their fridges though, also Belgian beers,
        and know what they sell.

        (The menu I linked to may not be complete, at least it was not when I wrote this.)

-   There are some interesting developments going on just north of the north-west corner 
    of the pentagon area, at the canal and close to the North station (which itself is a less
    pleasant area, on one side surrounded by large office buildings that are empty at night
    and on the other side the red light district and one of the more infamous areas of Brussels
    when it comes to safety).

    [Tour & taxis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mXcif6iS1zESueAz7) is a completely renovated old
    customs hall that now houses a food court and places for cultural events. There are also
    some new office buildings on the former site, including the main office building of the
    administration of the Flemish government. 

    Just north of the site there are two microbreweries with their own taproom:

    -   [Brasserie de la Senne](https://brasseriedelasenne.be/)
        ([Anna Bochdreef/Drève Anna Boch 19/21](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d1eBZAX3pp5q32V28))
        is named after the river that flows through Brussels (under Brussels would be a better
        expression as it is covered almost everywhere). The taproom , called Zennebar,
        is open every day except Mondays. They do serve some food also, but I am not sure 
        they do that on all opening days.

    -   [La Source](https://lasourcebeer.be/)
        ([Dieudonné Lefèvrestraat/Rue Dieudonné Levèvre 4](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R3b6wR69CpiGsEwe8))
        is my personal favourite small brewery in Brussels. 
        The [brewpub/taproom](https://lasourcebeer.be/pages/bar) is a bit tricky to find: It is in
        the far left corner of a big hall named [BE-HERE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gnDnV7FHpiyAubW68)
        that you enter through a port.

        They brew a variety of styles and their beers rarely disappoint me. 

        Closed on Monday and Tuesday though.

-   In case you would not fly back home on Friday afternoon and would like to learn how Lambic,
    the most famous beer from the Brussels area, is brewed (and what the difference is between
    Geuze and Lambic), you can visit the 
    [Cantillon Brewery and Brussels Museum of the Geuze](https://www.cantillon.be/?lang=en)
    which is also [not far outside the pentagon area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gxa1UGu3Anc2bd4h6).

    They brew an excellent Lambic and Geuze, but the taste of it may be a bit on the extreme
    end of the Gueze/Lambic spectrum and not everyone's thing. Personally, I think the beers
    from. e.g.,  Oud Beersel and 3 Fonteinen are a bit more accessible to most and as a starter
    in this kind of beer. So depending on how adventurous you are when it comes to the taste of
    beer, you may be very happy or a bit disappointed. But it is certainly interesting to see
    how this beer is brewed and to learn that its production in the Brussels area is threatened
    by global warming...

    The place is not open at night though.
