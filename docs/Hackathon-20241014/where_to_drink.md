# Curing mental distress after a hard day on LUMI

We do realise that at night, you want to forget all the misery from the day. 
The hunting for bugs, the temperamental file system of LUMI that freezes when you
want to save your file so that it takes ages to get out of the editor...

Belgium has a very famous medicine for curing that mental distress. It is called
"beer" and is available in large quantities allover the city, with something
for every taste and budget. Some are even made for people who need a very strong
medicine to forget. You cannot get it at pharmacies though (though the latter then
have a remedy for the day after if you take an overdose of the medicine "beer"),
but in specialised businesses called "bar" or "café".

-   [Moeder Lambic Fontainas](https://www.moederlambic.com/?lang=en) ([Place Fontainas/Fontainasplein 8]()) is a good choice 
    right in the city centre if you want a more typical place and not one that really aims at tourists as
    [Delirium Café & Taphouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1p9Vbt22M3XtUfMe8) or
    [Beer Capital Brussels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MJhrndDXxsSE52yp6).
    Moeder Lambic canno compete with these in number of beers, but they do have more than just the stuff 
    from the large breweries.
-   [La Porte Noir](https://www.laportenoire.be/)
    ([Rue des Alexiens/Cellebroerstraat 67](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Cq9AuWFGEZwJUjp8))
    is an underground bar in the basement of a former monastery. 
    The selection is small, but they do have a selection of nice beers.
    It is right next to the [Brasserie des Alexiens](https://www.brasseriedesalexiens.be/) 
    (Rue des Alexiens/Cellebroersstraat 63) which is a highly recommended restaurant.
