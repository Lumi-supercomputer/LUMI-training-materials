Just some suggestions. There are many more decent restaurants in Brussels especially
if you are alone or only with a small group. In general most places that score a 4 or more
on Google Maps are decent places. For vegetarians and certainly for vegans, the options may 
be a bit more limited. I couldn't check the menu of all these places, but often the choices
are limited. Brussels feels more like a southern European place in that respect than a modern
northern city. Traditional Belgian cuisine is very much focused on meat and fish dishes.
Moreover, the vegetables that were traditionally grown in the area have mostly lost popularity
so any dish based on them, has disappeared.

The first two are particular favourites of me, and after that I focus more on certain areas
with lots of restaurants.

-   [Brasserie des Alexiens](https://www.brasseriedesalexiens.be/) 
    ([Rue des Alexiens/Cellebroersstraat 63](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SdjPCkGM1oLWbBfE8))
    It opens only at 7pm. I've been there a few times with guests already who are always very satisfied.
    A highly recommended place. It is a bit more expensive, but then you also get a bit more space than in
    most other restaurants in this list. The place is in a former monastery.
    -   The bar [La Porte Noir](https://www.laportenoire.be/) next door is a good option for a beer before or afterwards.
  
-   [La porteuse d'eau](https://laporteuse.eu/en) 
    ([Avenue Jean Volders/Jean Voldersslaan 48](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7UhCW9KhghWZ6x4Y7))
    Interesting Art Deco building and interior, and the food is very much OK. It is a bit further away
    but still interesting for its architecture. There are more Art Deco restaurants in Brussels,
    but this one has the best reputation for the food. The vegetarian options are very limited though.
    -    Tip: Combine with the nearby bar [L'Ermitage Saint-Gilles](https://ermitagesaintgilles.be/) 
         ([Rue de Moscou/Moskoustraat 34](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rdehVg3gKfcP9EqP6)) for a local beer,
         or simply have some pub food in the bar.
         This bar is from a brewery in Brussels that started the bar elsewhere as the location had become too small.

-   Near the corner of the Kartuizerstraat and Arteveldestraat, not far from the Beurs/La Bourse,
    which used to house the Brussels stock market:
    -   [Fin de Sciècle](http://www.findesiecle.be/) ([Rue des Chartreux/Kartuizersstraat 9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/reHiRYPZX2uTwBYX9))
        The interior may not look nice at all but has character, and the food is good.
        It is a very busy place though, even during the week (which already shows that it likely 
        offers good value for money). I've been there with guests also and they too liked it.
    -   Diagonally opposite, at the corner of the street, is
        [9 et Voisins](https://9-et-voisins.be/), another busy place with a good reputation.
        Not as good as Fin de Sciècle though
        ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SE1fVfLuHJ4Az9SdA))
    -   Next to Fin de Sciècle is [Brasserie Greenwich Brussels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PygkK1Y7W8D6Uh9N8),
        also with an interesting interior. It used to be a pretty good place but I've heard less good
        things from them recently, and the place is definitely not as busy as it used to be which
        is already a sign.

-   And in the same area: Sint-Goriksplein/Place Saint-Géry and in particular two streets leading to that
    place: [Jules Van Praetstraat/Rue Jules Van Praet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fA2X61x2BhFuN4Cx6)
    and [Karperbrug/Rue du Pont de la Carpe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pDCpJ9DZoAmUc5kY7)
    are two streets with lots of restaurants, and in particular lots of Asian restaurants.
    As is often the case with streets with a high concentration of restaurants in the centre of Brussels and
    attracting lots of tourists also, there are very good places and some disappointments. So check 
    review sites if possible. This may be one of the more interesting areas for vegetarians.

-   Another nearby popular area is [Sint-Katelijneplein/Place Sainte-Catherine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5RZjhKwTZUufEfvH6)
    and surrounding streets, especially the Vlaamsesteenweg/Rue de Flandre.
    Most, but not all places there are decent . Personally, I don't thrust most of the fish restaurants
    on the corner of the big, long square (Vismarkt/Marché aux Poissons or Baksteenkaai/Quai aux Briques).
    They are too cheap to be able to offer a decent quality.
    On the Vlaamsesteenweg/Rue de Flandre there are also a couple of Asian restaurants which
    may be a good option for vegetarians.

-   The Rue du Marché au Charbon/Kolenmarkt is the gay street in Brussels, but it also has some nice places to eat
    where nobody has to feel uncomfortable. 
    -   [Café Charbon](http://www.cafecharbon.be/) ([Rue du Marché au Charbon/Kolenmarkt 90](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YX6RVyfhxXSJedGS9))
        serves good food, and especially the daily specials (on the board against the wall) 
        are highly recommended. I've been there with guests also before and they too were
        very satisfied.
    -   [Brasserie Le Lombard](https://www.lelombard.eu/) on the
        corner with the [Rue du Lombard/Lombardstraat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FvU68Y8aNcaks35g7) has nice food also. 
        You may have to order at the bar.
    -   [Le Plattesteen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Plattesteen/164972750182270) on the 
        [opposite corner](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xka8ff5g37uQL8LX8)
        has also a decent reputation. Not spectacular, but a bit less expensive than many other places
        and the price/quality ratio is certainly OK. The reviews are certainly rather mixed and waiting times
        can be a bit longer, but I've always had a decent meal there. They also have some more simple traditional
        dishes, as Belgium is not only about "steak frites".

-   Restaurants in the neighbourhood of HOEK 38 that should be OK:
    -    [La Tana](https://latana.be/) ([Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtsstraat 27](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3hTHvv5gqHhAYLrLA)) 
         is an Italian restaurant
         that also specialises in craft beers and has very nice Italian imports. The food is likely real
         Italian. E.g., the Pasta Carbonara that I had there, looked a lot more like what I would expect
         from reading the recipe rather than the typical cheese sauce with uncooked bacon or even ham 
         you get in many places. It has very much an "eat in the kitchen of an Italian" atmosphere, without
         any luxury. But unfortunately the opening hours of the business are very limited, making it only 
         an option on Wednesday and Thursday evening.
    -    [Per Bacco](https://www.perbacco-bruxelles.be/) ([Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtsstraat 31](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZtgaoDjqo2FecRcA))
    -    [Al Solito Posto](https://alsolitoposto.be/) ([Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtsstraat 73](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8oFGwqAdHnqwKror8))
    -    [Yuca Latina](https://yucalatina.be/) 
         ([Onderrichtstraat/Rue de l'Enseignement 18](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mdkoTwKP9qXXfNuu8))
         is a South-American restaurant with rave reviews on Google Maps, but also always busy which
         is already an indication.

-   Beenhouwersstraat/Rue des Bouchers and in its extension, Grétystraat/Rue Gréty: This is the tourist trap
    area in Brussels when it comes to food. It may be fun to walk through especially the Rue des Bouchers,
    but but don't be tempted by the man at the door who lures you in with offers that seem interesting.
    Some of those places are really dishonest and what you get inside is very different from what you
    expect outside. Some places are OK though, so check review sites or Google Maps.

    Some places that range from acceptable to very good:

    -   [Le Marmiton](https://lemarmiton.be/): A very good restaurant at 
        [the corner of the Galerie de la Reine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FgvAAzGzwZBvuxH97).
        A bit more pricey, and it may be hard to find a table there without a reservation. But it has been
        recommended to me by FWO and is a restaurant they often use for dinners with their review boards.
    -   [Aux Armes de Bruxelles](https://auxarmesdebruxelles.com/en/home-2/) 
        ([Rue des Bouchers/Beenhouwersstraat 13](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Qs7Tn8n452KrTd28)) 
        is a very large Belgian restaurant that tries to evoke an old-fashioned luxury atmosphere.
        It is OK but not spectacular. I've eaten there once. One dish I had was very good, the other
        was not a complete disappointment, but still a bit expensive for what I got. An easy choice though
        if you don't want to spent too much time looking for a place and want a varied menu.
    -   [Chez Léon](https://chezleon.be/en/the-menu/) 
        ([Rue des Bouchers/Beenhouwersstraat 18](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nL2hYByEVESajWtC8)) 
        is another one that you will find in all tourist guides, and it is a very busy place. 
        I wouldn't call it a tourist trap, but it is not as good as it should be for the price. 
        They claim an old-style Brussels atmosphere of a "frituur/friterie" (chip shop).
    -   Not in the street but nearby: [Mozart](https://mozart-resto.be/) 
        ([Petit Rue des Bouchers/Korte Beenhouwersstraat 18](https://maps.app.goo.gl/54wUSc3VFAqgVEiz7))
        Specialises in ribs, and has a good reputation

-   [Rue du Marché aux Fromages/Kaasmarkt](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b1akaEwhw4CEkyJE9) 
    is another street with restaurants very much oriented towards
    tourists. Contrary to the Rue des Bouchers, even some of the cheap places there serve very decent
    food for the price if you're travelling on a budget, e.g., Plaka, Hellas, Saffron and The Blue, 
    and the Italians in that street also seem to be decent. These places are certainly not spectacular
    and they don't use first-class ingredients, but then they are relatively cheap
    for a city like Brussels.

    [Baladi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XW7s1Bc3z9VB9AX1A), a Syrian restaurant in the nearby 
    [Rue des Chapeliers/Hoedenmakerstraat 16,](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XW7s1Bc3z9VB9AX1A)
    is definitely worth a visit.

-   Kind of interesting if you don't need a big meal, is the 
    [Wolf food court](https://wolf.be/) ([Wolvengracht/Rue du Fossé aus Loups 50](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zHNTTg9A9wsSxYm79)).
    Not all food stalls are as good though. The place does have its own microbrewery.
    You can order their beer in the middle of the hall.
