# Something for the night

If you're not too hungry after a hotel breakfast, big lunch at KTH and oversized snacks
during the coffee breaks, but want decent food and a good beer, these are some suggestions
for you (most of them tried at previous LUMI events in Stockholm):

-   The Bishops Arms - Vasagatan: Next to the central station, with a large selection of
    Swedish and foreign beers on tap and bottle/can, and good pub-style food (like burgers
    and fish & chips)

    [:material-google-maps:](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FVHVwHCqLMVKk3A4A)

    [:fontawesome-brands-untappd:](https://untappd.com/v/the-bishops-arms-vasagatan/3416)

    The Bishops Arms in Old Town (or Gamla Stan). This one has not been tried yet by LUSTers.

-   Hop & Vine

-   The old brewer Vasastan: Drinks and food. That place is a bit further from
    the central station and already closer to KTH.

-   Bryggeri Munkbron in the old town is a place just for drinks. There is no food.

-   Barrels burgers & beer and Tritonia Nordic Craft Beers by Brill in the old town:
    One and the same business, or likely two businesses with the same owner, as you 
    can walk from one in the other and order from both with a single bill. A busy place,
    but if you go a bit later it should be possible to get a table without long wait.

-   Stigbergets Fot: A very busy place in Södermalm, but close to the Slussen metro station
    (take the exist on the old town side of the platform) and the old town. 
    They have sandwiches and burgers and over 30 beers on tap,
    with an additional selection of bottles and cans. On weekdays, the place gets a little
    quieter after 8pm.

-   Omnipollos hatt: Omnipollo is a well know swedish craft brewery. This place
    in Södermalm (again close to Slussen) also offers pizza. Again a very busy place.

    Further away, on one of the blue metro lines, you also have Omnipollos Kyrka,
    their brewery, that also serves burgers. When visited by some people from
    LUST, the place was extremely busy and the seating not very comfortable, so
    they ended up eating in a nearby restaurant instead.

-   Oliver Twist is also a popular bar and restaurant in Södermalm close to
    the Slussen metro station and Stigbergets Fot mentioned before.

-   If you want to feel in Denmark: Yes, there is a Mikkeller in Södermalm
    (but LUST didn't try it yet)

    [:fontawesome-brands-untappd:](https://untappd.com/v/mikkeller-sodermalm/10632510)

-   If you want to feel in Scotland/UK: Yes, there are BrewDog pubs in Kungsholmen and Södermalm
    (but LUST didn't try them yet)

    Kungsholmen: [:material-google-maps:](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uCFCpwJ3A4wJDycY7)
    [:fontawesome-solid-link:](https://drink.brewdog.com/uk/kungsholmen)
    [:fontawesome-brands-untappd:](https://untappd.com/v/brewdog-kungsholmen/627361)

    Södermalm: [:material-google-maps:](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MHQuowdtcx9vn2Di6)
    [:fontawesome-solid-link:](https://drink.brewdog.com/uk/brewdog-sodermalm)
    [:fontawesome-brands-untappd:](https://untappd.com/v/brewdog-sodermalm/3476890)

-   If you decide to go to Södermalm and arrive before sunset, taking the free elevator 
    ["Katarinahissen"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cERThRGGEAppKbV98) for a view from the building
    and bridge connecting it to the hill, is also worth doing. And you don't have to walk 
    uphill anymore to go to Omnipollos Hatt, Oliver Twist or Stigbergets Fot.

This is a non-exhaustive list. There are more nice places near Old Town, the Central Station
and parts of Södermalm that are easy to reach by the metro (or of course other areas of
Stockholm).
