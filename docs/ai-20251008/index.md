# Announcement: Moving your AI training jobs to LUMI workshop - KTH, Stockholm, October 8-9, 2025

!!! Note
    If you are looking for course materials, check the pages of the 
    [previous edition in May 2025](../ai-20250527/index.md).

## Course organisation

-   Location: [KTH, Lindstedtsv√§gen 24, 114 28 Stockholm, Sweden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NPLtyuRe97euBSnL6),
    [room 522 "Fantum"](https://www.kth.se/places/room/id/c9ec01ab-b536-4be6-b82a-0d52ddadb2e6?l=en).

    The building is just a 5 minute walk from a metro station with excellent connections to the 
    central station (red metro line). See also the [SL web site](https://sl.se/en/in-english)
    for more information on public transportation in Stockholm.

-   Hotel suggestions for participants from outside Stockholm:

    -   [Elite Hotel Arcadia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CQSC4S78xREbGrTE9) is close to the 
        entrance of the KTH campus and the metro station serving KTH.

    -   Hotels in the neighbourhood of the central station are also a good choice as there is 
        a fast and high frequency metro connection to the KTH campus from there and as it is a
        good place to find restaurants or head into old town at night.

        The [Scandic Continental Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CQSC4S78xREbGrTE9) even sits
        right on top of the main metro station where you can jump on any line.

    Questions with longer-term relevance will be incorporated into the pages linked below.
    This HedgeDoc document will not be monitored anymore for further questions after the course.
    The link will likely die over time.

-   [Zoom link](https://cscfi.zoom.us/j/65207108811?pwd=Mm8wZGUyNW1DQzdwL0hSY1VIMDBLQT09) 

-   There are two Slurm reservations for the course. One for each day:

    -   First day: `AI_workshop_1` (on the `small-g` Slurm partition)
    -   Second day: `AI_workshop_2` (on the `standard-g` Slurm partition)

    Project with the compute resources: `project_465001958`.
    These resources are limited and should only be used for the exercises during
    the course and not for your own work.

## Setting up for the exercises

### During the course

More information will follow at the start of the course.


<!--
If you have an active project on LUMI, you should be able to make the exercises in that project.
To reduce the waiting time during the workshop, use the SLURM reservations we provide (see above).

You can find all exercises on our [AI workshop GitHub page](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/Getting_Started_with_AI_workshop)
-->

### After the termination of the course project

More information will follow after the course.

<!--
Setting up for the exercises is a bit more elaborate now.

The exercises as they were during the course are 
[available as the tag `ai-20251008` in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/Getting_Started_with_AI_workshop/tree/ai-20251008). Whereas the repository could simply 
be cloned during the course, now you have to either:

-   Download the content of the repository as 
    a [tar file](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/ai-20251008/files/ai-20251008-Getting_Started_with_AI_workshop.tar)
    or [bzip2-compressed tar file](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/ai-20251008/files/ai-20251008-Getting_Started_with_AI_workshop.tar.bz2)
    or [from the GitHub release](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/Getting_Started_with_AI_workshop/releases/tag/ai-20251008)
    where you have a choice of formats,

-   or clone the repository and then check out the tag `ai-20251008`:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/Getting_Started_with_AI_workshop.git
    cd Getting_Started_with_AI_workshop
    git checkout ai-20251008
    ```

-   Or you can download them as a [.tar.gz file](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/ai-20251008/files/LUMI-ai-20251008-Exercises.tar.gz) 
    or [ZIP-file](https://462000265.lumidata.eu/ai-20251008/files/LUMI-ai-20251008-Exercises.zip).

Note also that any reference to a reservation in Slurm has to be removed.

The exercises were thoroughly tested at the time of the course. LUMI is an evolving supercomputer though,
so it is expected that some exercises may fail over time, and modules that need to be loaded, will also
change as at every update we have to drop some versions of the `LUMI` module as the programming environment
is no longer functional. Likewise it is expected that at some point the ROCm driver on the system may
become incompatible with the ROCm versions used in the containers for the course.
