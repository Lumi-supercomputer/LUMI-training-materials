These materials can only be distributed to actual users of LUMI (active user account).

!!! Note "Alternative for modifying `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`"
    Instead of using
    ```LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH```,
    you can also use the module [lumi-CrayPath](https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/l/lumi-CrayPath/). 
    Loading it essentially does that setting for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, unloading tries to restore the old situation, 
    and reloading while the module is already loaded, will adapt to a possibly modified `$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. 
    (So basically use it after loading all other modules that you need.)
