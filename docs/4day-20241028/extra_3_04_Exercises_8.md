# Exercise session 8: perftools

The files for the exercises can be found in `Exercises/HPE/day3/perftools` and
its subdirectories. Follow the Readme.md description (per each directory) and get familiar with the perftools commands and outputs.

-   Subdirectories `perftools`, `perftools-api`, `perftools-hwpc`, `perftools-python`, and `perftools-apa` 
    need `lumi_c.sh` (or `lumi_c_after.sh`) to be sourced.

-   Subdirectories `perftools-for-hip` and `perftools-for-omp-offload` 
    need `lumi_g.sh` (or `lumi_g_after.sh`) to be sourced
