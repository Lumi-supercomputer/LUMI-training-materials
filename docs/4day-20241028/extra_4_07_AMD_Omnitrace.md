## Q&A

1.  Where is `omnitrace`? `module spider omnitrace` or `module load omnitrace` do not show anything.

    -   They are part of the rocm stack, so available as part of the rocm module. This is for ROCm 6.2. For older versions look here https://hackmd.io/@sfantao/lumi-training-ams-2024#Omnitrace. There is a module that you can load after including a new path.
