# Exercise session 4: Placement

<!--
The files for the exercises can be found in `Exercises/HPE/day2/Binding`
and `Exercises/HPE/day2/gpu_perf_binding`.

Try different binding options for CPU execution (look at slides and use envars to change order and display the order) and for GPU execution (gpu_perf_binding). See also the PDF or `README.md` files in those directories.

Check slide 6 and 7 of the exercise assignments for more information.
