!!! Note
    [Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/), the "program" used to visualise the output of omnitrace, is not a regular application but 
    [a browser application](https://ui.perfetto.dev/). Some browsers nowadays offer the option to install it on your
    system in a way that makes it look and behave more like a regular application (Chrome, Edge among others).
