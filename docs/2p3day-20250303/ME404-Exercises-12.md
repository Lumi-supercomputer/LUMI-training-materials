# Exercise session 12: Cray MPICH

The files for the exercises can be found in `Exercises/HPE/day2/ProgrammingModels`.
Test the Pi example with MPI or MPI/OpenMP on 4 nodes and 4 tasks.
Show where the ranks/threads are running by using the appropriate MPICH environment variable.
Use environment variables to change this order (rank-reordering).

Alternatively, continue with the previous exercises if these are more relevant for your work.
