# Introduction to the AMD ROCm<sup>TM</sup> Ecosystem

<!-- Cannot do in full italics as the Ã£ is misplaced which is likely an mkdocs bug. -->
*Presenter: Samuel Antao (AMD)*

Course materials will be provided during and after the course.

There were some sound issues at the start of the talk that could not be corrected in the
video.
