# Where to eat?

Just some suggestions. There are many more decent restaurants in Brussels especially
if you are alone or only with a small group. In general most places that score a 4 or more
on Google Maps are decent places. Just some suggestions:

-   [Brasserie des Alexiens](https://www.brasseriedesalexiens.be/) (Rue des Alexiens/Cellebroersstraat 63)
    -   Opens only at 7pm
    -   The bar [La Porte Noir](https://www.laportenoire.be/) next door is a good option for a beer before or afterwards.
-   [Fin de Sciècle](http://www.findesiecle.be/) (Rue des Chartreux/Kartuizersstraat 9)
    -   The interior may not look nice at all but has character, and the food is good
-   [La porteuse d'eau](https://laporteuse.eu/en) (Avenue JEan Volders/Jean Voldersslaan 48)
    -    Interesting Art Deco building and interior, and the food is very much OK. It is a bit further away
         but still interesting for its architecture. There are more Art Deco restaurants in Brussels,
         but this one has the best reputation for the food.
    -    Tip: Combine with the nearby bar [L'Ermitage Saint-Gilles](https://ermitagesaintgilles.be/) 
         (Rue de Moscou/Moskoustraat 34) for a local beer,
         or simply have some pub food in the bar.
         This bar is from a brewery in Brussels that started the bar elsewhere as the location had become too small.
-   [Moeder Lambic Fontainas](https://www.moederlambic.com/?lang=en) (Place Fontainas/Fontainasplein 8) is a good choice for decent food
    with a good Belgian beer. They have more than just the stuff from the large breweries.
-   The Rue du Marché au Charbon/Kolenmarkt is the gay street in Brussels, but it also has some nice places to eat
    where nobody has to feel uncomfortable. [Brasserie du Lombard](https://www.lelombard.eu/) on the
    corner with the Rue du Lombard/Lombardstraat has nice food. Order at the bar with your drinks.
    [Le Plattesteen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Plattesteen/164972750182270) on the opposite corner
    has also a decent reputation. [Café Charbon](http://www.cafecharbon.be/) (Rue du Marché au Charbon/Kolenmarkt 90)
    serves good food also, and the daily specials are definitely recommended.
-   Restaurants in the neighbourhood of HOEK 38 that should be OK:
    -    [La Tana](https://latana.be/) (Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtsstraat 27)
    -    [Per Bacco](https://www.perbacco-bruxelles.be/) (Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtsstraat 31)
    -    La Bottega (Rue de l'Enseignement/Onderrichtsstraat )
-   [Aux Armes de Bruxelles](https://auxarmesdebruxelles.com/en/home-2/) (Rue des Bouchers/Beenhouwersstraat 13) 
    and [Chez Léon](https://chezleon.be/en/the-menu/) (Rue des Bouchers/Beenhouwersstraat 13) 
    -   A very touristic street and with a bad reputation as many of the restaurants are true tourist
        traps. But if you want to eat there for the atmosphere of the street, these are two decent
        options, each with their own character.
-   [Mozart](https://mozart-resto.be/) (Petit Rue des Bouchers/Korte Beenhouwersstraat 18)
    Specialises in ribs, and has a good reputation
-   Rue du Marché aux Fromages/Kaasmarkt is another street with restaurants very much oriented towards
    tourists. Contrary to the Rue des Bouchers, even some of the cheap places there serve very decent
    food if you're travelling on a budget, e.g., Plaka, Hellas, Saffron and The Blue, and the Italians
    in that street also seem to be decent. Baladi, a Syrian restaurant in the nearby Rue des Chapeliers/Hoedenmakerstraat 16,
    is definitely worth a visit.
