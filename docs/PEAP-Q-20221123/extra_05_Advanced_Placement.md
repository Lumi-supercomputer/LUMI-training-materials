## Q&A

1.  I have a question regarding `srun`: does it forward options to the underlying MPI implementation? with OpenMPI you can get a report of the binding using â€”report-bindings 
    - Yes, it forwards the options to pmi
    - It is possible to get a report and we will mention tomorrow how to do that. But it can be done by option or environmental variable.
